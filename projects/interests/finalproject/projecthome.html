      <p>Photography is the art of taking pictures to capture moments, people, and places. It allows us to save memories and tell stories without using words. With a camera or even a smartphone, anyone can take photos and express their creativity. Photography helps people see the world in new ways by paying attention to light, colors, and details. It is a fun and useful skill that beginners can learn step by step with practice  </p>
      <p>Cameras are an important tool in photography because they help capture images clearly and accurately. Different cameras have different features, but all cameras work by letting light into the lens and recording it as a photo. Learning how to use a camera helps photographers control focus, brightness, and motion in their pictures. As beginners practice using their camera, they start to understand how settings like zoom and modes affect the final image. With time and practice, camera use becomes easier and helps improve photo quality.
