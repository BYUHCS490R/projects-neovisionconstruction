            <p id="we">In CSS we can select items in many ways. We can use the tag name to select all of one type, like all tags. We can use an ID to select one unique element with #, or a class to select many elements with .. We can also select children inside another element, or group different selectors together to style them the same.</p>
            <p class="bigger"><span class="diff">2. What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</span></p>
            <p id="used">An ID is used for one special element on the page, while a class can be used for many elements. In CSS, an ID is written with # and a class is written with .. IDs should be unique, but classes are reusable.</p>
            <p class="bigger"><span class="diff">3. What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</span></p>
            <p id="inline">A span is an inline tag, so it stays in the same line with the text and is good for styling small words or phrases. A div is a block tag, so it takes the whole line and is good for grouping bigger sections of content.</p>
            <p class="bigger"><span class="diff">4. What is the difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER?</span></p>
            <p id="just">A div is just a plain container with no meaning. Header, main, and footer are semantic tags, which means they tell us what the content is for. A header is usually the top section, main is the main content, and footer is the bottom section of the page.</p>
            <p class="bigger"><span class="diff">5. What are the different ways to select a color?</span></p>
            <p id="pick">We can pick colors in CSS using names like red, hex codes like #ff0000, RGB values like rgb(255, 0, 0), or HSL like hsl(0, 100%, 50%). We can also use RGBA or HSLA if we want the color to be see-through (transparent).</p>
