        <h3>Title and Topic</h3>
        <p>The title of my website will be <strong>Beginner Photography Guide</strong>. The topic of the site is to help beginners learn the basics of photography, including different types of cameras, fundamental rules, example shots, common mistakes to avoid, and tips for improving their skills. The site will be educational, easy to follow, and visually appealing.</p>
        <h3>Why I Chose This Topic</h3>
        <p>I chose this topic because photography is a creative skill that many people want to learn but often feel intimidated by. I enjoy taking photos myself and want to create a resource that can help beginners understand photography concepts in a simple and practical way. This topic is fun, engaging, and provides plenty of visual content to make the website interactive and interesting.
</p>
<h3>Content on Each Page</h3>
<p>The homepage will introduce photography as a hobby and explain the goals of the website.
Page 1 will cover types of cameras, including DSLR, mirrorless, point-and-shoot, and smartphone cameras, with short descriptions of each.
Page 2 will cover basic photography rules, such as the rule of thirds, lighting, focus, and framing techniques.
Page 3 will include example shots in a table format, showing different photography settings (aperture, shutter speed, ISO) and the resulting images.
Page 4 will describe common mistakes beginners make, such as blurry shots, poor composition, and improper lighting, along with tips to avoid them.
Page 5 will include a contact form where visitors can ask questions, submit their favorite photography tips, or request feedback on their own photos.

<h3>How I Will Collect Content and References</h3>
<p>I will create most of the content myself using my personal photography knowledge and practice. I will also research reliable online photography guides, tutorials, and free images licensed for educational use. Two references I plan to use are:

* Photography Life <a href="https://photographylife.com/">photography life</a>
* Digital Photography Schools like digital photgraphy links

I will properly cite all sources and ensure that all images used are either my own or free to use legally.

<p>I have read and understand the warnings. I will not copy content from other websites except for small quotes with proper citation. All writing, HTML, and CSS will be my original work. I will not copy another student’s work or use copyrighted images without permission. I also confirm that I will not use ChatGPT or any AI system to generate the HTML, CSS, or content for my final project.</p>
