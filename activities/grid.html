            <li>In HTML, elements are structured in a hierarchical manner, with a parent element containing child elements. This type of relationship becomes important when using CSS Flexbox or Grid because layout properties are specified on the parent container, and it controls the arrangement of its children. Using display: flex or display: grid on a parent, for instance, controls the alignment, space, and order of all the child elements. Keeping such a relationship in mind enables the designer to easily control layouts and prevent children from behaving unexpectedly.</li>
            <li>The main differences between CSS Grid and Flexbox are in their dimensionality as well as uses. Flexbox is one-dimensional, arranging items along one row or column, which is suitable for linear arrangements like toolbars or menus. CSS Grid, which is two-dimensional, allows for control of columns as well as rows simultaneously, making it better suited for complex page layouts like full-page layouts. Whereas Flexbox is great for small things and simple alignment, Grid is more powerful in general for structural layouts.</li>
