  <p><b>1. What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</b><br>
  JPEG is best for normal photos with lots of colors, like pictures of people, nature, or places.</p>

  <p><b>2. What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</b><br>
  GIF is good for simple pictures or animations, like logos or cartoons, because it only supports up to 256 colors.</p>

  <p><b>3. What is unique about the PNG format?</b><br>
  PNG keeps the image quality high and supports transparent backgrounds, so it is great for logos or images used on top of other designs.</p>

  <p><b>4. How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</b><br>
  Open it in a photo editor (like Paint, GIMP, or Photoshop) and change the width and height before saving it.</p>

  <p><b>5. Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of CSS?</b><br>
  Because CSS only makes the picture look smaller on the webpage, but the file is still big. 
  Editing software makes the file smaller, which helps the page load faster.</p>
