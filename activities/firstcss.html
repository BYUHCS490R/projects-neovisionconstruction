        <h1>CSS</h1>
        <p>  Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</p>
        <p1>Inline CSS is written directly inside an HTML tag and only affects that one element. Embedded CSS is written inside a style block in the pageâ€™s <head> and affects elements on that page. External CSS is in a separate .css file and can style many pages at the same time.</p1>
            <p>Explain why you should only use external CSS.</p>
            <p1>External CSS is best because it keeps your HTML clean, makes it easy to change styles in one place, and can be used on many pages. It also helps pages load faster because browsers can save the CSS file.</p1>
<p>What is a selector used for?</p>
<p1>A selector is used to choose which HTML elements the CSS styles will apply to, like all <p> tags, a specific id, or a group of elements with the same class.</p1>
